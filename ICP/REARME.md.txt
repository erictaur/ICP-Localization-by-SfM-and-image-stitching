This package is for the project of the course EECS 504 at 2020 Fall.

The goal of the project is to construct the 3D map from 2D images, and then use the local 2D image information do the localization tracking. The main localization algorithm is Iterative closest point (ICP).

A series of drone images is used as the example. The results were recorded as a video.
